  Just tell the new Claude Code session:

  "Please read docs/context/claude_conversation_context.md to understand the full 18-week OOP transformation plan. We're currently in Phase 1, Week 1 and have completed the project structure setup. Continue implementing the centralized configuration management system as the next step."

  The new session will:
  - Read the complete context and understand exactly where we left off
  - See the branch and directory structure we created
  - Continue with the configuration management implementation
  - Follow the same systematic approach

  Your progress is fully documented and preserved in the repository, so tomorrow's session can pick up exactly where we stopped!
